# Things I Want to Do

Now that I have the code base configured with the latest versions, I can finally work on the application! I'm going to use this file as a progress tracker, wish list, and any other details I need!

## Maintenance Tasks

- Test App (on phone) to make sure everything is working as expected
- Refactor Components
- Refactor Hooks and Utils
- Reenable `rules-of-hooks` and deal with issues
- Reenable `exhaustive-deps` and deal with issues

## Wish List

- Measurements with Screen Off
- Live View Measurements
- Apple Watch App
- Progress Notifications when Screen is Off
- Redesign (maybe)
  - Homepage
  - Measuring UI
  - Branding, Colors, Images, and Icons
- Animations
- Analytics
